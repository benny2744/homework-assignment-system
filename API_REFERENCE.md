## üìä Response Status Codes

| Code | Meaning | Usage |
|------|---------|-------|
| 200 | OK | Successful request |
| 201 | Created | Resource created successfully |
| 400 | Bad Request | Invalid input data |
| 401 | Unauthorized | Authentication required/failed |
| 403 | Forbidden | Access denied or capacity reached |
| 404 | Not Found | Resource doesn't exist |
| 409 | Conflict | Resource exists or limit reached |
| 429 | Too Many Requests | Rate limit exceeded |
| 500 | Internal Server Error | Unexpected server error |

## üîí Security Considerations

### Rate Limiting
- **Login attempts**: 5 per 15 minutes per IP
- **API calls**: 100 per minute per session
- **File uploads**: 10 per hour per teacher

### Data Validation
- All inputs are validated server-side
- SQL injection prevention via parameterized queries
- XSS prevention through input sanitization
- File upload restrictions (type, size)

### Session Management
- JWT tokens expire after 2 hours
- HTTP-only cookies for security
- Secure flag in production
- SameSite protection against CSRF
